Notes on the proxy:

The state variables cannot be removed or have their order changed. This is due to Storage Clashes.

This specific proxy pattern combats the issue of Function Selector Clashes by only allowing admin to call admin functions and other users to only call non-admin functions.

"
If the caller is the admin of the proxy, the proxy will not delegate any calls, and will only answer management messages it understands.
If the caller is any other address, the proxy will always delegate the call, no matter if it matches one of the proxyâ€™s own functions.
